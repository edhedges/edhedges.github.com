Soâ€¦ I have recently gotten sidetracked on my blog work because I have
been working on a django boilerplate for myself. The goal of my
boilerplate is to be as simple/customizable as I need it to be. Another
main goal for this boilerplate is that it should easily be pushed my
production server hosted by [WebFaction][].

Once I am done with the boilerplate and have tested and streamlined my
development process I will be finishing up some blog changes as well as
porting my current site to the boilerplate.

My boilerplate will live on my [github profile][].
