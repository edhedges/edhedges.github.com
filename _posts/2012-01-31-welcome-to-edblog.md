Welcome to edBlog! This is my first of many posts I will be making here on edBlog. I plan to blog about my life, code, web stuff, and basically anything I find interesting.

edBlog is a simple blogging application I built for my own use. It is built using the django framework which is awesome by the way. Django is a web framework built in python. If you are interested go ahead and read more about it [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

I have recently gotten into web development in python/django and have been loving it. I am planning writing some useful little scripts and also developing some slightly larger applications for the web. Stay tuned here for updates and also don't forget to "fork" me over at [my github](https://github.com/edhedges).

I think that is all for now thanks for reading.
