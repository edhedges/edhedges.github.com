As for right now I am writing my posts in simple html but I would like
to start using [markdown][] so that will be my next update to the blog
app. After that is complete I have one more update I want to put on and
that is to allow comments possibly using [OpenID][]. Lastly I plan on
building an API for my blog.

After that I should be done with the functionality I want. I plan on
then doing free lance web design and development as well as a couple web
app ideas I have in mind. Overall I just want to immerse myself more
into [python][], [django][], and the web in general.
