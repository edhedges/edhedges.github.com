I have accepted a job at [ACEware][]. I will be working on a web
application using [java][] and [Eclipse][]. I am pretty excited to start
working for ACEware and expanding my skills in the area of web
development.

#### Updates on personal projects:

I have started getting a custom admin for edBlog. I currently have the
ability to make a post and most of the basic admin functionality written
I just need to implement a way to automatically “urlify” my titles. I
haven’t implemented the new features like uploading a picture, the
ability to comment, or using markdown but that will be coming soon.
