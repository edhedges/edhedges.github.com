In previous posts I have talked quite a bit about what types of programming I do and other nerdy stuff but in this post I would like to recognize **ALL** the tools I use daily for programming purposes as well as just fun. I think the best way to do this would be in list form, so here goes:

#### Hardware ####
* [MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.8](http://www.apple.com/) - I have had this laptop since the summer of 2008. I got it as a graduation present and still today it is a wonderful machine. It has 2.5GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processing power and 4 GB of Ram. Overall a great machine and I hope that when I get a new mac I am not disappointed because this one has spoiled me.

#### Software ####
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - This is my browser of choice. If you like applications that are easy to use, fast, and powerful then Google Chrome should be your browser. The first time I tried chrome I immediately knew I wasn't ever going to be happy with another browser. I highly recommend this not only for web development/design but for general all purpose web browsing. Also IE sucks.
* [Apple Mail](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/software) - I have been using Apple's built in email client since before I had my laptop. There isn't a better email client out there in my opinion. I use it to manage my gmail, k-state, and new ACEware email accounts. I think mac users will agree that apple mail beats out any other mail client be it a desktop or web interface.
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) - This is the newest addition to my toolset and it is completely amazing. Sublime Text 2 is a beautiful and powerful text editor. I have used [Notepad++](), [TextWrangler](), and many other text editors but none come close to Sublime. I purchased it for $60 and it has been a wonderful investment.
* [Terminal](http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal) - This is the coolest application on the Mac hands down. Terminal is a command line application allowing access to be able to control the UNIX base. In high school I liked using terminal for small things such as typing: `say I am a robot`. This command would signal the computer to output the phrase "I am a robot" in an audio version. It hasn't been until more recently that I have used it for more productive things such as ssh, git and github/bitbucket, fabric and in a more broad sense executing python code. I could go on and on about more specific things I do with terminal but I'll save that for a future post.
* [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) - Another application that has recently grown on me is FileZilla. FileZilla is an application that allows me to do ftp. I have used WinSCP for Windows and Cyberduck for Mac but when I found FileZilla I haven't looked back. FileZilla is free, cross-platform, user friendly, and powerful.
* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) - This application is an integrated development environment mainly used for Java but can be used with other languages. I used eclipse my first year at K-State in the intro programming class when I learned Java. I have picked it back up to use at my new job at [ACEware](http://aceware.com/). I am using it for Java web development using the jsf framework and richfaces.

#### Web Resources ####
* [Google](https://www.google.com/) - Google is my go to resource for everything. I honestly don't know what I would do without it. Why read a book when you can just google it right?
* [github](https://github.com/) - A place where coders can collaborate and store their project by using git.
* [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - Similar to github but not as pretty in my opinion. I use bitbuckets free private repos for deployment since I don't want people to be able to see if I have sensitive information in my live code.
* [Django](http://djangoproject.com/) - This is my main resource for making django powered sites and applications. Django rocks!
* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) - An interactive html5 and markdown editor for the web. I write my blogs and README.md files with Dillinger.
* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) - I use reddit for pleasure as well as to stay updated on what other web developers and web designers are doing. This reddit [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev+python+django+web_design+webdesign) is one of my favorites to browse for learning purposes.

Resources are great! I highly recommend everything on the list. If there are any questions about any of the information make sure to comment or [contact me](http://edhedges.com/contact/).
