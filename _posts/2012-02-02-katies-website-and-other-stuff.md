I just want to give a shout out to my fiance [Katie Phillips][] for
building a website in [iWeb][]!

I had told her before that I would build her a website but she didn’t
think she needed one but this year she is taking a class about using
technology in the classroom and one of her assignment was to make a
site. I am proud of her because to be honest she isn’t that tech savvy.

##### Now on to some news about what I will be working on next.

I plan on making my blogging application great and here is a list of
some of the things I want to add to it.

-   A custom admin because I am using the django admin at the moment and
    even though its awesome if I want to distribute this app and have
    others use it their should be a custom admin.
-   An ability to leave comments on a post. I haven’t decided whether to
    make them anonymous or have users sign up for a simple account yet.
-   The ability to upload pictures to make it look more appealing.
-   I currently make my posts by writing html that goes into my page
    from the admin but I want to start using [markdown][]. I am really
    excited for this part because I found an awesome online editor
    called [Dillinger][].

Lastly I know there are tons of blogging apps out there in many
languages but I am building this app because I want it to be the
simplest (for users) as well as learn many things along the way.

Thanks for reading!
