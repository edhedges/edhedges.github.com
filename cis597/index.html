    <hr />
    <p>Welcome to my CIS 597 - Information Systems Project home page.</p>
    <p>I appreciate and would like to thank <a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~dan/">Dan Andresen</a> taking time out of his schedule to be my faculty advisor on the project.</p>
    <h4>The Birth of FormLegend</h4>
    <p>I came up with the idea for FormLegend (still not sure about the name) just before the semester had started. I had moved my personal website (this one) from django powered to completely static. The benefits I got from this switch are easy deployment on basically any host and lightning fast load times. I currently let GitHub host my personal website for free! My move from django to static was better in almost every way. The only thing I am currently missing is a contact form. Without some backend code I can't validate my data, make sure I wasn't being spammed, or send the submitted data in an email to myself. That is how the idea for FormLegend came to be.</p>
    <h4>FormLegend Overview</h4>
    <p>FormLegend will use javascript cross-domain message passing to submit user created forms rendered on the users website to my django powered back end. All data will be stored in a PostgreSQL relational database and hosted on Amazon Web Services.</p>
    <p>A typical user will go through a typical registration process, which will then allow them to log in and start building forms. The user will be allowed a total of 5 form creations. Each form a user creates will be tied to a domain name (for security purposes) and after creation a piece of markup and code will be generated so the user can place it on their website. Once placed on their website the user will see the form rendered on their page. When submitted my app will validate the form and handle form submission. Validation errors and successes will be displayed by the generated form quickly after submission.</p>
