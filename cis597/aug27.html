    <h4>Work Summary</h4>
    <p>On this day I met with Dan Andresen and told him about FormLegend. He thought it was a good one and will be my faculty advisor for the project. This talk was very useful for me because his questions helped me think about FormLegend in a more modular way. I believe thinking like this will allow me to develop it quickly and efficiently. The biggest thing he stresssed was testing during development as well as once a "rough draft" is complete.</p>
