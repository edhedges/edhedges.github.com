<p>Ok, so first a little background on when I got my Mac. When I graduated in May 2008 my mom and stepdad took me to an <a href="http://store.apple.com/us">Apple Store</a> and I thought it was the coolest place ever. I walked out with a brand new Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM and 250GB of HD space and a sweet bookbag especially made for carrying laptops. I was on top of the world, but looking back on myself and how I used my Mac back then, I’m slightly embarrased.</p>

<p>I had become the <a href="http://imgace.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2000-facebook-machine.jpg">typical Mac user</a> and loved every minute (<a href="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/482/template.jpg">Oh God why?</a>). The applications I used consisted of Safari, iTunes, Microsoft Office 2008, Mail, and a little bit of iMovie. What I am trying to get at is that I could have done all the things I was doing on a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> product for a much cheaper price. That didn’t matter cause I had a Mac! Don’t worry this post isn’t about bashing on Macs because I love them or bashing on people that own Macs, well not all of them :).</p>

<p>Although I started out a typical scrub Mac user I learned a more about the awesome of Macs during my summers as a technology assistant at <a href="http://www.fredoniaks.com/USD484/Home.html">Fredonia Highschool</a> and ever since then I have continued to learn and don’t plan on stopping.</p>

<h4 id="terminal">Terminal</h4>
<p>The best application that I learned about was Terminal (if you have a Mac find using Spotlight ( Space + Command ) or in /Applications/Utilities/ ( Shift + Command + U )). I first learned the simple <code>say</code> command. Here are some examples you should try once Terminal is open.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">say Hello, World!

say I did not know Macs were so awesome.

say Eddie Hedges is a cool dude.</code></pre></div>

<p>You can do this with any string of letters and or numbers. There is also a list of different voices you can make it say. The voices can be found in System Prefrecences under System then Speech. Under the Text to Speech tab there is a System Voice drop down list which contains the voices. Here are a few examples of how to change the default voice.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">say -v Good This is the good news voice!

say -v Agnes I am Agnes.

say -v Cellos The weather could definitely be cooler yeah</code></pre></div>

<p>While these are very simple commands there are some more complex ones that do things like allow you to play a text based game and even watch Star Wars IV right from Terminal!</p>

<p>The following command will start up a text based game so read and try typing stuff in there. Have fun! You can quit the game with ( control + C ).</p>

<p>Play a text based game</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">emacs -batch -l dunnet</code></pre></div>

<p>The following command will start up Star Wars Episode IV in ASCII.</p>

<p>Watch Star Wars Episode IV</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code></pre></div>

<p>I realize that all of these things aren’t very productive but I use terminal daily for my programming needs. I use it to SSH, scripts, starting all kinds of services, making files and folders, opening files in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> and git with GitHub. It helps me be productive and makes me feel like a leet haxor. Okay so now to the point of the post.</p>

<h4 id="what-it-all-comes-down-to">What it all comes down to…</h4>
<p>College and high school students are wanting a Mac because it is cool and it almost hurts to watch people pay over two times as much money for a computer that they don’t know how to use to its full potential, when they could just buy a cheaper one that also has an internet browser and Microsoft Office built in! I’m a supporter of Apple products but I don’t think that purchasing a Mac because it is “cool” is a smart idea. That is the only reason I wanted a Mac, but I got lucky because I am no longer “wasting” the power of my Mac and the money that was spent on it has definitely paid for itself.</p>

<p>The gist of it all is don’t buy a product that you won’t get your moneys worth out of because not everyone gets lucky like me.</p>
